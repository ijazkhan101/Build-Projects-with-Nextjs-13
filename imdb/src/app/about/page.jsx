      <p className="mt-5 ">
        IMDb (an acronym for Internet Movie Database)[2] is an online database
        of information related to films, television series, podcasts, home
        videos, video games, and streaming content online â€“ including cast,
        production crew and personal biographies, plot summaries, trivia,
        ratings, and fan and critical reviews. IMDb began as a fan-operated
        movie database on the Usenet group "rec.arts.movies" in 1990, and moved
        to the Web in 1993. Since 1998, it is now owned and operated by
        IMDb.com, Inc., a subsidiary of Amazon.
